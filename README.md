# Code-Refactoring-on-HTML-and-CSS
Description:
In the project, Code-Refactoring-on-HTML-and-CSS the main concept of doing this project was to refactor pre-existing code and to improve upon the html and css. To start off, I removed all div elements in the html structure and replaced them with semantic html tags to help described the structure of the webpage. In addition, I also removed repetitive div classes using the same properties and conjoined them by their semantic element tags makiing it less redundant. Furthermore, I added alternative text atributes to all img tags to make it more accessible for screen readers as well as when the image doesn't load properly. Altogether, I learned that by supplementing content flow to the webpage it better described the details of a webpage and by providing more accessibility to the webpage it opened up access to users with restriction.
